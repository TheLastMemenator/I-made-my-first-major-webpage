      <summary>What are the two phones?</summary>
      <p>The Galaxy S24 FE is an upper-mid-range phone with many flagship features, including an RTX chip, powerful processor and 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED display --- and OneUI 7.  It was  released in 2024 as a  cheaper alternative to the flagship Galaxy S24 series. The S10+ is a full-blown flagship from 2019 that is a good rival to the S24 FE, and even wins in the screen resolution. It even has a headphone jack (3.5mm), but the S24 FE does not. Today we'll see  who wins where and if they're still valid in 2025!</p>

    <div class="display">
    <p class="credit"><b>First of all, Display.</b></p>
    <div class="1">
      <img src="20250430_190958.jpg" alt="S24 FE" width="700" class="j" /><p class="cap">Not the sharpest, but hey, it's 120Hz!</p>
      <img src="20250430_192510.jpg" alt="S10+" width="700" class="sharp" class="j" /><p class="cap">The sharpest, but only 60Hz but it's overclockable to   90hz, though!</p>
    <p class="credit">The display on the S24 FE is an ultra... not a massive upgrade from the <b>S10+'s WQHD+ (2960*1440)</b> resolution display, if at all. It does have a <b> FHD+ (2680*1920 if I'm not mistaken)</b> However, the <b>S24 FE</b> <b>natively</b>  supports <b>120Hz</b> refresh rates, <i>unlike</i> the <b>60Hz found on the S10+</b> (you CAN over clock it but the screen may overheat, same for the cpu). They are <b>both Dynamic AMOLEDS</b>, and none are LTPO. </p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Verdict: </b>S24 FE wins due to high refresh rate and decent resolution.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="battery">
    <p class="credit"><b>Next, battery.</b>
      It can get you throughout the <b>entire day</b> on <b>moderate usage</b>, so like no COD on ultra but not just staring at a blank screen either. <b>5000mAh compared to the 4100 offered of the S10+</b>. <i>Without</i> battery-saving, I'd say that you'd be good for around <b>10h</b>, and with battery saving you'd get a <b>FULL DAY</b> (<i>refresh rate becomes 60Hz tho</i>).</p>
    <p class='credit'><b>Verdict:</b> The S24 FE wins by a landslide.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ssd">
    <p class="credit"><b>Storage and RAM</b></p>
    <p class="credit">The S24 FE has options of <b>128-512GB</b> of internal SSD (i don't know the type), I mean <b>same for the S10+ </b>but the SSD on the <b>S24 FE is much faster</b>  and needs less energy. Also, as the owner of both systems, i should say that the <b>S10+ is still very good in 2025. Both have options of <b>8,12,16GB RAM options</b>, but the S24 FE features LPDDR5X, being far faster and way more more power-efficient than that of the S10+'s DDR4.</b> </p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Verdict:</b> The S24 FE wins, but the S10+ is a good competitor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="camera">
    <p class='credit'><b>Camera</b></p>
    <p class="credit">Both systems feature a <b>telephoto and ultrawide system</b>, but the <b>S24 FE has a 50MP main cam as opposed to the S10+'s 12MP system</b>. The S24 FE also has excellent <b>Galaxy AI that enhances photos</b>, and even a <b>RAW pic  mode for uncompressed images</b>. The videos? <b>Both have 4K 30FPS, FHD 30/60FPS and HD 30/60FPS. They both have HDR10+, and  have OIS (Optical-Image Stabilization).</b></p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Verdict:</b> The S24 Wins (again)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chipset">
    <p class="credit"><b>CPU and GPU</b></p>
    <p class="credit">The <b>S24 FE has an EXYNOS 2400e</b> (<i>e is the lite version of the 2400</i>) while the <b>S10+ has either a SnapDragon 855 or the EXYNOS 9820</b>. The S24 FE is far faster, more powerful, and the chipset <b>supports advanced AI features like image search, build, create</b> and other things like ChatGPT but integrated. The <b>10+ only has basic Ai, like Google  Assistant (Not GEMINI)</b>. The <b>GPU on the S24 FE SUPPORT RTX</b> (<i>Yes, you heard that right!</i>) and <b>will handle heavier duty games</b> <b>like CODM on ultra, 120FPS or maybe Drive Zone Online with max settings and also 120FPS</b>. The <b>S10+ still has a fair 60FPS on COD and a laggier 27FPS on Drive Zone Online. Asphalt 9 is 60FPS on the S10+</b>, but <i>that phone overheats like hell</i>. <b>Asphalt 9 is also 60FPS for me</b>, because I couldn't find the 120FPS option. I don't play other games like Fortnite or genshin so i can't really say it's true performance. </p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Verdict:</b> The S24 FE Outperforms the S10+ in all ways imaginable.</p>

    <div class="charging">
    <p class="credit"><b>Charging</b><p>
    <p class="credit"><b>The S24 FE Has options of</b>:<br>
    - 25W Super Fast Charging<br>
    - 15W Fast Charging<br>
    - Anything under that is "charging". <br>
    Can Charge your phone from 0-100 in roughly 50min.<br><br>
      <b>The S10+ has:</b><br>
      - 15W  Fast Charging<br>
    </p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Verdict:</b> While both charge fairly quickly, the <b>S24 FE</b> takes the cake.</p>

      <p class="cap">Also premium-quality, lighter and has a curved WQHD+ display. Feels a bit plasticky compared to the S24 FE, though.</p>
    <p class="credit"><b>Overall Build Quality</b></p>
      <p class="credit">The <b>S24 FE, of course, has a metal overall, glass front and glass back</b>. The <b>S10+</b>, on the other hand, is a <b>much thinner phone with a curved display</b> to show off on its premium feel. However, the <b>S24 FE has a glass and aluminum all-around body</b>, while the <b>S10+ is a bit plasticky on the back</b>.</p>
      <p class="credit"><b>Verdict:</b> The S24 Wins, due to its aluminum and glass finish and slightly heavier weight. <b>The S10+ has a headphone jack</b> (3.5mm), though.</p>

      <p class="credit"><b>So all-in-all, the S24 takes the crown in everything other than the screen resolution.Also, it will recieve 7y of software support from 2024, as opposed to the S10+'s 7y from 2019. I have One UI 7 on my new phone already. Fun fact, you can defend yourself with an S24 FE as it's practically the weight of a brick and as hard as obsidian --- the S10+ is not.</b></p></div>
